# How to run
I've only managed to run it with Processing 2.x. See also "Augement reality with Processing" (search google) for an excellent tutorial.

To run:
* Place the nyar4psg-1.3.1 folder inside your /sketchbook/libraries/ folder (where Processing sketches are stored)
* Run the AR_tracking program (remember to inclde the data folder that contains the needed data.
