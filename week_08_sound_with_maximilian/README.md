# Introduction to sound

## Lab assignment
* Install [Maximilian](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian). Dowload the repository from github and look inside the openFrameworks folder. You should find a folder called _ofxMaxim_. Move that folder to the addons directory inside your openFrameworks root directory. Keep the rest somewhere safely so you can look at it later too. Start an empty project and select ofxMaxim from the addons list.
