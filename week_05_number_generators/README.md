* perlin noise
  * some history
  * terminology and technicals
  * in 2D
  * examples
* sine / cosine

## Lab assignment:
Complete the assignments below, in the order provided. Whatever you don't finish in class, complete it at home for next time.
* __mandalaShapes:__ Go back to last week's assignment and add to the movement sine oscillation rather than the basic, rigid back and forth that it has.
* __harlemShake:__ A grid of dots gets into the internet meme.
* __noisySun:__ Using noise to create a custom shape.

## Homework assignment:
* __noisySun:__ Do the "further development" modification proposed in the exercise. Make any adjustments you find interesting.
* __revisiting past asignments:__ how about revisiting some of the old assignments and adding some noise or sine movement?
* __Reading:__
  * Nature of Code p.17-26 (found in the resources folder)
  * Appendix B in the "Mastering openFrameworks - Creative Coding Demystified" book which can be found in the resources folder.
