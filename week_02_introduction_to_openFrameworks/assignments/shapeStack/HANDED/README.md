# Shape stack
Try to recreate what you see in the __shapeStack.png_ image.
## Instructions
* Start a new project with projectGenerator
* Define your window size to 600x600 pixels (in the _main.cpp_)
* Set the circle resolution to 200.
* I don't mind the color or exact sizes of the shapes, but I want a big rectangle, a smaller circle and an even smaller rect so that they don't "bleed" out of the shape underneath.
* Make sure the shapes are in the center of the canvas.
