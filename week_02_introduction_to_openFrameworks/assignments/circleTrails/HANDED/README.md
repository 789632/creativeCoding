# Circle trails
Write code that reproduces the circle trails as shown in the _circleTrails.mp4_ video file.

## Instructions
* Start a new project called _circleTrails_ and set the size of the window to 800x500 pixels.
* In the `setup()` function of the _ofApp.cpp_ file make sure you stop the automatic refreshing of the canvas and the initial backgound to black.
* Set the circle resolution to 50.
* Inside the `draw()` function you'll need to draw a white circle and then a red, smaller one inside it. Both should be where the mouse is.
* Now that the background is not automatically refreshed what's an alternative way of "covering" the old circles? What color should this entity have?
