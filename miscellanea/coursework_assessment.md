## Final project assessment

### Video demo (10%)
Video documentation of the Creative Coding project you undertook. It should have some background information of your work such as:

* what you tried to achieve
* what inspired you
* details on technical implementation, algorithms & processes
* video demonstration of the code running
This information can be communicated either via a voice over, you speaking to the camera or subtitles. This demo should be enough to give someone an idea of what your project is about without having to compile and run your code. Ideally, you should start documenting early, filming bits of you working on it, reaching milestones so that it properly reflects the actual process of creating a computational art piece (ie. don't leave this for the night before submission).

### Project description (20%)
On a blog I will create, you'll need to post a description (along with your video and link to code), documenting the project (500-1000 words). You should indicate clearly what the goal of the project is, and what you tried to achieve, the challenges you faced and what possible future development you see in it. In cases where you have used other peoples work, you should reference appropriately.

### Source code (70%)
Set of downloadable source code. This should be commented as much as possible to explain your work. The code should be archived in zip format for others to study.

## Miscellenea
### On borrowing code
It's only natural that you'll borrow code from others. After all that's what openFrameworks and the Free Software movement are all about. However, an assignment or final project can't be based completely on someone else's code. When you borrow code you must add value to it. Use it to achieve something original that fits to your idea and project and is not just a replication. Also, in most cases you are expected to more or less understand what's in the code you borrowed. Finally, and most importantly, you are expected to properly cite your sources.

### Due date
* __Term 1 project__: Friday 25th December 2015 @ 11.59pm
* __Term 2 project__: April 5th 2016 @ 11.59pm

Please note: staff are __not__ allowed to give extensions to deadlines. If you have a serious reason there is an official procedure which you need to follow by speaking to your personal tutor.

### Key assessment criteria:
- How well the project meets its intended aims as described in the project description.
- How well the project demonstrates an understanding of topics covered in class.
- How well the project meets the scope expected of students studying at masters level in terms of technical competence (as appropriate for the programme of study).
- How effective the work is as a creative piece with respect to its stated aims

__Term 1 vs. Term 2 project:__ The difference between the 2nd Term's project is that given the great experience you've had, you are expected to dwell into more advanced techniques, whether they are the ones we saw in class, such as computer vision, machine learning, or techniques that did didn't necessarily touch on in the classroom. You are expected to demonstrate a deeper understanding of code and to use it to create computational art. Note that it is perfectly acceptable to use the work you're going to do in term 2 as a starting point for your final piece. This is however not mandatory. In any case, the work you'll submit in term 2 has to "stand on it's own".

### Grading :
* __70 or above:__ Work which demonstrates considerable effort, meeting all the above requirements, and in addition, demonstrating understanding beyond topics covered in class.
* __60-70__: Work which demonstrates considerable effort, meeting all the above requirements, but not going beyond topics covered in class.
* __50-60:__ Work which demonstrates some effort, and meeting most of the above requirements.
* __40-50:__ Work which does not demonstrate great effort, and meets only a few of the above requirements. Work which is borderline in terms of suitability for submission at masters level.
* __below 40:__ FAIL - Work which has not been adequately attempted, demonstrates little effort and/or insufficient understanding.
