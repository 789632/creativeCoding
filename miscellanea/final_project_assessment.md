## Final project assessment

### How to submit your final project
To submit your project go to [this page](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~tpapa001/comparts/wp-admin/) and register. Once you register login and follow these instructions:
* Click on __Portfolio__ in the right column and then on __Add New Work__. A new page should now open on the right hand side. Enter a title in the title section at the top. In the __Category__ field enter the words "final projects 2016" (without the quotes). Also, on the right-hand side check the category __final projects 2016__. This is very important. If you don't do it your project won't appear in the portfolio page.
* Click on the __Thumbnails__ tab. Change the __thumbnail width__ to 3 columns. Everyone should get the same "real estate" on the page. In the __Thumbnail image__ section click to upload a 640x480 image. Please respect this ratio once again! You can upload the same image for the section called __Project Panel thumbnail__.
* If you want others to share your work more effectively you might want to also edit the information in the __Share__ tab entering 2-4 sentences that best describe your work which will be used when the work is forwarded. Same goes for image.
* Now for the important bit! Go to the __Content__ tab and click on the big yellow bit to start adding content. The content page is split into 12 columns. The first and last 2 are left empty and only the middle 8 are occuplied. To make your life easier I created a template for you to copy. This template creates a project page like [this](http://goo.gl/RfkbKi). To use this template click on the __Templates__ button in the top and in the dialog box that opens select __final project template__. Click __Yes__ to overwrite the current content.
* You should now be seeing a page with some of the required content. I say some because the full requirements are listed on this page and not on the template. If you click on any of the sections a dialog box appears asking you whether you want to __single edit__ or __column edit__. The easy way to edit this page is to do __single edit__ where you only change the content of the sections I created for you. This way you can edit the title/short description the video, the photos etc.
* When you are done click __Save__ on the top right and immediate on the next screen __Update__.
* If you did everything right you should be seeing your work appear [here](http://goo.gl/LRTKsf). Make sure that all the media play, and all the links work!
* __FEELING BRAVE?:__ You are welcome to add different layers, but always click on the three vertical bars in the top-left of the top bar in order to __add multicolumn__. The first element of this multicolumn should always be a __spacer__ of 2 columns width. The next 8 columns can we anything you want, an image, text, a gallery or a collection of other columns (like in my example). You can also replicate my layers. When you click on any of them and select __Column Edit__ on the yellow bit at the top of the new area tha opens are two squares. Click on that to replicate one of the structures I made if you want to add more images or videos withouth going through the hassle of creating a grid from scratch. Make sure the final result is 8 column wide though, just like in the template, with 2 columns margin on the left and right. What you do in the middle 8 columns is up to you.

### Documentation / report
* __2nd year MFA students:__
  * word count: 2,000-2,500 words
  * weight: 33% of final grade
* __MA students:__
  * word count: 1,000-1,500 words
  * weight: 20% of final grade

#### What to include in the report
* Background research / what inspired you
* What you tried to achieve / project description
* Your process / diary
* Reasoning for your choices
* Challenges you faced
* Details on technical implementation, algorithms & processes __(please don't copy-paste code)__
* Possible future development
* video demo (optional by highly recommended): If your work involves static images or a physical object, you could show images, but in most cases a video communicates your work very well. If you ommit the video demo you should have a __very__ good reason for doing so. The ideal video should be about 2-3 minutes, enough to give someone a taste of your work.
* link to source code clearly indicated. Upload code on gitlab and link to that.

## Miscellenea
### On borrowing code
Please reference other people's work appropriatly and when you have borrowed code from others state it so clearly both in the reference section of your report + in the comments of the code

### Due date
* __report:__ 1st of September. We need the report earlier than the final piece so that the external examiners have time to read it.
* __final piece:__ You will be examined by a small group in the morning of the 8th of Sept.

### Grading :
