# Quick-fire presentations
This Tuesday @ 2pm, we'll be doing quick-fire presentations in class. The style is similar to the PechaKucha only you'll have __3 mins__ for __6-10 slides__ instead of the pechakucha usual.

## FAQ about Tuesday:
* __Do I have to have a presentation?__<br/>
YES! YES! YES! Please don't come without one.

* __Do I have to have 6-10 images/slides?__<br/>
YES! Everybody has to make at least 6 and maximum 10 slides.

* __Can I have a bit more than 3 minutes?__<br/>
No!

* __Can I play a video?__<br/>
Only if it is within the presentation (no clicking out of it) and it lasts less than 20 seconds. After that time you'll have to move on. Also, you can only show 1 video maximum in your presentation.

* __Can I play an audio file?__<br/>
Same as above. No clicking away from the presentation. Only if it is part of that slide and the whole thing lasts less than 20 seconds. You can play only 2 audio files during your presentation but their total length has be less than 20 seconds.

* __Will comments/questions be allowed?__<br/>
Yes, while the next person is getting ready with his/her laptop.

* __What should I include?__<br/>
[Here](http://blog.indezine.com/2012/05/10-tips-to-create-and-present-pecha.html) are some tips about a Pecha Kucha presentation. Remember yours will be only __3 minutes__ long. Notice that it's about images and NOT text. What you could _potentially_ show us:
  * things that influenced you
  * screenshots of stuff under construction
  * sketches of what you want to achieve in the end
  * possible ways of interacting with object
  * technologies you are using
  * challenges you faced

## Some advice:
* Please don't put text on slides that we have to read. It's more about images and hearing you talk!
* Please don't put text there that you read back to us! During the presentation try to look at the audience the whole time!
* Keep it fun/fresh!
* Do a rehearsal at home so that you can time and assess yourself. Prepare something we will all enjoy.
* See it as a rehearsal for the presentations infront of the curating students.
* Come with 6-10 slides! Don't show up with a piece of paper that you read from! We want to see images/slides!

I'll bring some wine. We might need it.
