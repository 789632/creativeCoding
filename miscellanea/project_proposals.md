# Project Proposal
__Term 1 vs. Term 2 project:__ The difference between the 2nd Term's project is that given the great experience you've had, you are expected to dwell into more advanced techniques, whether they are the ones we saw in class, such as computer vision, machine learning, or techniques that did didn't necessarily touch on in the classroom. You are expected to demonstrate a deeper understanding of code and to use it to create computational art. Note that it is perfectly acceptable to use the work you're going to do in term 2 as a starting point for your final piece. This is however not mandatory. In any case, the work you'll submit in term 2 has to "stand on it's own".

## Presentation:
Your presentation will take place during the labs of this week. You will have 10 minutes for your presentation. If you are not using your own laptop please upload the relevant materials suitable online storage (or on the sandbox of gitlab).

## Getting inspired
Students sometimes have set ideas about what they want to explore, but most don't. If you need a bit of inspiration visit the links at the [bottom of this page](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/comp_arts_2015/workshops_in_creative_coding/tree/master/week_01_introduction_to_art_tech_free_software) where I have listed project aggregators and artists.

You should also play with some of the addons [here](http://www.ofxaddons.com/categories). Compiling the examples that often come with addons isn't hard. See Appendix A (pg. 311) in the book [Creative Coding Demystified](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/comp_arts_2015/workshops_in_creative_coding/blob/master/general%20resources/Mastering%20openFrameworks%20-%20Creative%20Coding%20Demystified%20%28Denis%20Perevalov%29.pdf).

What's also useful is to compile and see as many of the examples that come with openFrameworks. See inside the "examples" directory of your openFrameworks folder.

## Presentation Brief:
Produce a powerpoint/keynote presentation for a piece of computational art. The proposed work should demonstrate an understanding of creative practice either through the creative content of the work itself or through its affordances. __Important:__ Images, links to external resources, and video are strongly encouraged provided they are properly referenced.

Your presentation should cover __all__ of the following topics. Students also found mockups or rough sketches a usefule way of showing what they planned to do, alongside the presentation.

## Topics to Cover

### Project description
- Describe in brief and then more fully exactly what the project is going to do.
- Make it very clear

### Audience
- What you expect to convey, how your audience will  be effected

### Background research
- Survey of similar works
- Analysis other works and placement within art genre 
- personal reflections on other work and why it will be relevant to your project

### Methods and tools
- Report on investigation into a particular addon, library or technique with a mind to using this research in your final project 
- List any areas for further investigation

### Project work plan
- A production schedule with milestones

### Potential pitfalls and contingencies
- What might go wrong with your project? 
- How will you resolve these issues?
- What is your minimum viable product?
