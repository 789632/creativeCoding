#### Description
This page holds course materials for the level 4 Masters course, Workshops in Creative Coding for the MA/MFA Computational Arts.

The course will introduce you to a range of techniques and practices for creating interactive audiovisual software. This will include computational and process-based thinking, perspectives on audio and visual perception, algorithms for creating graphics and sound, advanced topics in computational media and project development.
</br>
</br>

#### Objectives
- Provide the student with a fundamental understanding of code and modern computer literacy.
- Introduce and apply programming concepts and techniques using openFrameworks/C++.
- Approach programming from an artistic perspective.
- Allow for the emergence of open dialogue regarding the content being instructed.
- Invoke the student's interests to apply what they have learned outside of class.

On successful completion you will be able to:

- Program interactive installations
- Develop algorithms for generating images and sound
- Reason about the aesthetics of computer art pieces
</br>
</br>

#### Your goals:
1. Develop an understanding of computational techniques and processes for making audiovisual software
2. Deliver two working software projects that explore specific areas of computational art and/or computing, one of which should be substantial.
</br>
</br>

#### Assessment
Workshops in creative coding is a 30 credit course divided over two terms. Assessment is by two projects as well as homework assignments. One project is due in term one and a second in term two. The second project is intended to be substantial in nature, and may be a pilot study for any Masters Project work which follows. For more details on projects click on [assessment](assessment.md).

#### Absences
Unless you provide a valid, document-supported excuse absences are not allowed in any course. If you must miss a class get in touch __in advance__ and explain what the issue is.
