# Advanced Generative Algorithms

## Topics
* introduction to advanced generative algorithms
* genetic algorithms
  * basic principles
  * advantages and applications
  * genes, genotype and phenotype
  * evolutionary pipeline
* recursion recap
* fractals
* L-systems
  * generative grammar

## Lab assignment
* __geneticPhotoboothMod:__ Modify the genetic photobooth to make it draw with other types of primary shapes.
* __superformulaGeneticSculptor:__ Selective breeding of superformula shapes as a way of refining your generative designs.
* __realisticRecursiveTree:__ Adding realism in the recursive tree.
* __smart-L-system:__ Making smarter L-systems by adding stochasticism.

## Homework assignment
Finish and extend some of the lab assignments for the weekly show-and-tell session.
