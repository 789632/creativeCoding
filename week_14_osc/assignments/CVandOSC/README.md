# CV and OSC
* Turn one of the programs from the weeks we saw computer vision to a sender of OSC packages and convert the procReceive to something that displays all the information.
* Why not extend it so that it sends it via broadcast (see slides) to more than 1 machines (you'll need >1 computer for this).
