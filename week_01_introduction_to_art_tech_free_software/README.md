## Introduction to art, technology, FLOSS & you

### Lab assignment
* Put in your calendar the induction to the Goldsmiths Digital Studio: __Thursday Oct 8th @ 11am__
* Fill out your name, email address + campus ID [here](https://goo.gl/Tqb3cy). Make sure you've typed it correctly and that you are not editing someone else's line.
* Login with your campus username/password on [Gitlab](http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/).

### Homework assignment
* Fill out the start-of-class [questionnaire](https://marinero.typeform.com/to/SzhbSO).
* Read Golan Levin's [Beyond Photoshop with Code](http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_4x4/) for why coding is importand to digital artists.
* Read Julian Oliver's interview: [Network as a material](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/network-material-interview-julian-oliver) for yet more reasons why a digital artist should not be limited by a company's proprietary software tools and why Free Software is a good artistic practice.
* Download an IDE:
  * __Mac__: download [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12). The page has instructions too. Especially for Mac make sure you do this at home because XCode is 4GB(!). Don't worry if you don't manage everything. We are going to spend some time in class sorting out problems out too! Give it a shot nevertheless.
  * __GNU/Linux (Ubuntu)__: install codeblocks by opening a terminal and running: `sudo apt-get install codeblocks`
* Download openFrameworks:
  * __Mac / Linux__: Go to your home folder and create a directory called `bin`. Then fire up a terminal and type: `cd ~/bin` and press _enter_. This will lead you to the directory we just created. Then type: `git clone https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks.git` and press _enter_. This will start the download which will take a bit of time as it's about 1.5GB. Then type `cd openFrameworks/` and press _enter_. Then type `git submodule init` and press _enter_ and finally type `git submodule update` and once more press _enter_. (__GNU/Linux only:__ follow these [instructions](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-codeblocks) too).

* Write to me at t.papatheodorou@gold.ac.uk if you haven't received an email from comparts@doc.gold.ac.uk
* Two designated volunteers prepare presentation on an artist each.

### Further reading
* Watch [RevolutionOS](https://youtu.be/jw8K460vx1c?t=1) that tracks the history of the Free Software Movement.
* Chapters 7 & 9 from [Free as in Freedom](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/)
* [Linux is a cancer](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/): a word from Steve Ballmer
