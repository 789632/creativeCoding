## Lab assignment:
Commplete the assignments below, in the order provided. Whatever you don't finish in class, complete it at home for next time.
* __solarSystem:__ Program the planets as indicated. This will lead to the assignment for home.
* __dumbAgents:__ Instead of rigidly embedded in a grid, the pixel becomes an agent and moves freely around the screen.
* __generativeShapes:__ Kadinsky determined that the point, line and plane are the holy trinity of every form. In this exercise you'll use the mouse location to generate shapes.

## Homework assignment:
* __solarSystemArt__: Let's draw with the moon. Remove the planets and vary speeds and distances to create generative curves.
* __animatedBrushes__: Previously, dumb agents and planets were autonomous. This time users interact with an agent. Drawing becomes like a ballroom dance with a partner.
