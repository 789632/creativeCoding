# Week 4 - Repeat! Repeat! Repeat!

## Topics
* repetition in the arts
* early computer reproductions
* modularity
* Loops
  * why do we need them?
  * while loops
  * for loops
* vectors
  * initalizing + using
  * vector operations [push_back](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/), [pop_back](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/pop_back/), [erase](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/erase/), [size](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/size/)
* how to build the oFx examples

## Lab assignment:
Complete the assignments below, in the order provided. Whatever you don't finish in class, complete it at home for next time.
* __Examples building:__ Make sure you have generated all the openFrameworks example project files.
* __magneticGrid:__ A grid of shapes reacts to the mouse as if it were magnetic.
* __triangleVectors:__ Adding and removing elements on the canvas dynamically using vectors.
* __mandalaShapes:__ The ritual symbol in Indian religions reproduced and powered by an oscillator.

## Homework assignment:
* __Finish_lab_assignments:__ Explore at least one of them in the ways suggested in the bottom of each exercise (or in a way that produces interesting results).
* __Explore the examples:__ Complie a few of the examples in the openFrameworks/examples directory. See which ones you like best.
* __Reading:__
  * On _loops_: Chapter 6 from the Learning Processing book. Most of the syntax is very similar.
  * On _vectors_: An in-depth [tutorial](http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/c++%20concepts/001_stl_vectors_basic.html) from the ofx site. No need to finish it all, but it's a good page to read.

## Further reading:
* Gideon Obarzanek's patterns from [this](https://youtu.be/qaT64TYsVgA?t=209) live performance don't seem so impossible now. The grid of lines which appears when you click on the link is just a for loop with rotations. Easy!
