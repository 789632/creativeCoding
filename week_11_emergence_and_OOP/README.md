# Emergence & OOP

## Topics
* Emergence of complexity in:
  * the brain
  * a termite colony
  * society
* Introduction to OOP
* Classes v. Objects
* Objects in array
* Objects within objects
* Why OOP?

## Lab assignment
* __Game of Life:__ Run and modify the code provided for the game of life.
* __Black Death:__ A simulation of an infectious disease.
* __Optional:__ Have a look at the dna helix one given as a homework assignment.

## Homework assignment
* __Coding:__ Finish the above assignments and add your own modifications.
* __DNA helix (optional)__ If you're feeling up to it, why not try to copy Memo Atken's [Simple Harmonic Motion](http://msavisuals.com/simple-harmonic-motion-5/). You'll need to use the `sin` function to have each node move up and down (with different phase) and depending on the distance to the closest point draw lines between them of that intensity (using `ofMap()`). When the nodes pass from the line in the center a sound can be generated.
* __Reading:__ 
Read the introduction to Object Oriented Programming from the online ofx [book](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html).
